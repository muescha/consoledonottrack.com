# Console Do Not Track (DNT)

{{ site.description }}

Gatsby has `GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`.  Homebrew has
`HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS`.  Etcher has... well,
[nothing](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/2057).

This is a proposal for a single, standard environment variable that plainly
expresses an OPT OUT by a user of software to any of the following:

* ad tracking
* usage reporting
* automatic update phone-home
* non-essential requests of any kind to the creator of the software

<span class="reallybig">export DO_NOT_TRACK=1</span>

# PRs and Status

* coming soon
